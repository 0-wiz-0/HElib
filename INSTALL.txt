Installation Notes

You will need GMP and NTL libraries.

Many distributions come with GMP pre-instralled.
If not, you can install GMP as follows.

1. Download GMP from http://www.gmplib.org
2. uncompress and cd into the directory gmp-XXX
3. On the command line:
      ./configure
      make
      sudo make install
4. This should istall GMP into /usr/local

Once GMP is installed, you can install NTL as follows:
(NOTE: you will needs v6.1 or NTL of higher)

1. Download NTL from http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html
2. uncompress and cd into the directory ntl-XXX/src
3. On the command line:
      ./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=on
      make
      sudo make install
4. This should install NTL into /usr/local


Now that you have these libraries in place, you can cd to
the helib src directory to build helib.

Right now, the "build system" for helib is very rudimentary:
no configure script and just a Makefile, which does not support
installation of helib.  So what you can do directly is simply
build the static library fhe.a in the helib src directory
and build programs based on fhe.a, also in the helib src
directory.  Hopefully, this build system will be improved
in the future.

Before building helib, you may want to look at the Makefile,
and consider adjusting some of the defaults for CC and CFLAGS.
The defaults should be OK on most systems, but you can see
the suggested options, which are documented in the Makefile.

On the command line in the helib src directory:

   make

will compile and build the library fhe.a.
Once built, run

   make check

which will compile and runs a series of test programs.

If you want to build your own program based on helib, the easiest
way to do it is to write the program in a file called myprog.cpp
and then run

   make myprog_x

which will compile myprog.cpp and link in fhe.a and all required
support libraries, and create the executable myprog_x.

Take a look at Test_General.cpp for an example program using helib.
